# password-generator
## Description
### Project purpose was to create a random generator box that generates a password for the user once the user selects the criteria for their password. Password length could not be less than 8 characters or exceed 128 characters. Password prompt should include how many characters user wants in their password and whether user prefers uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. A password should then be generated based on the criteria the user selected.     
## User
### User should be able to see a box titled "Generate a Password" and a button that when pressed/clicked, a prompt box appears which asks them to select their preference for password characters. Once user fills out all criteria based on their preference, a randomly generated password should appear in the box that meets all the criteria set by the User.
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and was also used to deploy the website when edits where finished and final version needed to be deployed. Visual Studio Code was used to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to add onto a starter code that was given. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update website.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make a new HTML file titled index.html, a new CSS folder titled style.css, and a new JavaScript folder called script.js and make sure that both the CSS and JavaScript folders are linked on the HTML file. Start on HTML code and once that is completed, start on your CSS file, and then on the JavaScript file and view all changes and progress made in the "Open Browser" extention-search for and install "Open in Browser" extention in the VS side bar. 
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed. Once changes are uploaded, navigate to the settings where your repository is displayed on GitHub and scroll down to Pages in the sidebar. Once there, under Source, select Branch:main and save. A link will then appear and although it will take time, the website will be ready.
